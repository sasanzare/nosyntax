# Symbols ⌨️  

A tool to clean up text by removing all non-alphanumeric characters, leaving only letters and numbers.  

## ❓ Problem Statement  

There is a problem with your keyboard: it randomly writes symbols when you are typing a text. You need to clean up the text by removing all symbols.  

## 🎯 Task  

Take a text that includes random symbols and filter it to retain only letters (a-z, A-Z) and numbers (0-9).  

## 📌 Input Format  

A string containing letters, numbers, and random symbols (e.g., `%`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `*`).  

## 📝 Output Format  

A string with all symbols removed, preserving only alphanumeric characters and spaces.  

## 🔍 Example  

### Sample Input  
```plaintext  
%l$e%ts go @an#d@@ g***et #l#unch$$$  
```  

### Sample Output  
```plaintext  
lets go and get lunch  
```  

### Notes  
- Spaces between words are preserved.  
- Only letters and numbers remain in the output.  
- Case sensitivity is maintained (uppercase/lowercase letters stay as-is).
